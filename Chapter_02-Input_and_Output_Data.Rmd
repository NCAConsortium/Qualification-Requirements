# General Consideration
The data specification in this section assumes an "NCA function" that calculates the PK parameters from one concentration-time profile (i.e., a series of time/concentration value pairs) that represent the sampled data for one subject after the administration of a drug at time zero. In addition, there are variables that contain subject or data specific characteristics or NCA options to be used when calculating the PK parameters. 

# Input Data: Analysis Data
These are the concentration-time profiles and the dosing data that are actually analyzed by the NCA function. 

* Concentration inputs (the concentration measurement and time point vectors have to be of equal length):
    * Vector of concentration measurements:
        * the concentration (for the examples within, below the limit of quantification, BLQ, is indicated by the value of zero)

    * Vector of time points for concentration measurements:
        * Nominal time since first dose
        * Nominal time since most recent dose (also referred to as reference dose for the profile)
        * Actual time since first dose
        * Actual time since most recent dose (also referred to as reference dose)
* Dosing inputs:
    * Dose definition:
        * The route of administration (e.g. "intravascular" or "extravascular")
        * If the data are single or multiple dose
        * If multiple dose, if steady-state has been achieved
        * The amount of the dose
    * Dose time inputs (all are zero for single-dose):
        * Nominal time since first dose
        * Nominal time since most recent dose
        * Actual time since first dose
        * Actual time since most recent dose
* Interval inputs:
    * the IntervalTimeRange (range of times for parameter calculations, e.g. 0 and 24 for AUC0-24);
    * the LambdaTimeRange (range to be used for lz estimation);
    * the length of the dosing interval (tau; this may be detected from the dosing data);
* Calculation inputs:
    * how to handle loq-values (what loq-rule to be applied)
    * flags for what datapoints and/or subjects have to be omitted

# Input Data: Characteristics
* Limit of Quantification
    * (Optional) the lower limit of quantification
    * (Optional) the upper limit of quantification
* Analyte
    * (Optional) flag that indicates that the analyte is a metabolite and not the parent drug

## SDTM Alignment

The following is intended to assist with the creation of data for testing validation and with general knowledge about SDTM.  Please refer to the SDTM and ADaM standards for complete information.

While not required for this standard, it is recommeded that raw data should conform to the SDTM PC domain and EX domain specifications for concentration and dosing data, when possible.  Analysis data should conform to the SDTM ADAM standard as closely as feasible; when the ADAM ADNCA specification becomes standardized, this document should be revised to align with that standard.  SDTM column names are not required but are preferred, and any software should detect SDTM-formatted data by default.  Other standards may be used, and the minimum specifications are provided above.

* Concentration dataset (`pc.xpt`)
    * Concentration (SDTM column: PCSTRESC or PCSTRESN)
    * Sample time (derived from SDTM columns PCDTC, PCRFTDTC, and PCELTM)
    * Lower limit of quantification (SDTM column: PCLLOQ)
    * Upper limit of quantification (SDTM column: PCULOQ)
    * Specimen collection date and time, or start of specimen collection (SDTM column: PCDTC)
    * Specimen collection ending date and time (SDTM column: PCENDTC)
    * Time of last dose (SDTM column: PCELTM or PCTPTNUM)

# Output Data

Outputs should align with the SDTM PP domain.
